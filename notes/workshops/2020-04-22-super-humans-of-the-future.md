# Introduction

The future is now. We have pivoted quickly to remote working, changing how we manage our work and each other.

What are my intentions in attending this workshop? What is the desired outcome or result?
I'm not sure. I want to be a good MYOB citizen inside and outside of the office. I want to be more mindful both at work and in personal life.


# Same shit different day

Just like building muscles through exercise, our mental capacity needs to be built. It takes practice to be creative. The same old thinking produces the same old results. 

Creativity isn't a gift that you're born with. Though some may be more creative than others, it's a skill that can be learned. It encapsulates so many different things into one concept: creating solutions to problems, finding new ways to do things, or inventing. Changing the scope, it might mean something different for a child: playing, building, or imagination. 

When something is too new, it can be exciting but also daunting. Too familiar and it can become monotonous to the point where we just autopilot. Creativity is best manifested somewhere in the middle.

Creativity often isn't something entirely new. It could be perceived as being new but in reality it is built on existing foundations e.g. the iPhone was not the first smart phone; the Blackberry and devices built the foundation for the smart phone.

The simple act of reframing something can make it much more enticing.


# Creativity as a mood

[John Cleese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleese), co-founder of Monty Python, said:
> Creativity is not a talent, it's a way of operating

Creativity is largely unrelated to IQ at IQ levels beyond a basic threshold. The most creative people are those that are able to get themselves into the mood or mode which facilitates the ability to access their natural creativity.

Creativity is, at it's simplest form, playing. We must be deliberate about getting into the creative space. When really stressed out, we're not feeling at our best and struggle to produce our best work. That's not to say that stress is always bad; a little bit of stress can help push and motivate us.


# Open and closed modes 

John Cleese describes two contrasting modes of operation - open and closed. 

The open mode is divergent, relaxed, expansive, exploratory, receptive, playful, and humorous. The mode allows our minds to consider a range of thoughts and explore broadly.

The closed mode is convergent,rigid, purposeful, tunnel-visioned, and hierarchical. It can be characterised by a "lots to do" or "go mode" mindset. It is efficient, but not necessarily effective. 

Most people spend most of their time in the closed mode. The modes should be balanced against the task at hand. When we simply must get something done, an open mode can lead to being too cruise-y and poor results. But when we want to come up with new ideas and be creative, a closed mode would hinder the process.

It is important to aim to return the open mode following the closed mode. This allows our mind to be reflective and accept feedback for what transpired in the closed mode. We can determine what improvements are possible. In this state of mind, we are at our most aware, receptive, creative, and intelligent.


# What kills creativity?

Tiredness, insecurity, trying to prove yourself, stress, impatience, lack of confidence, tiredness, vulnerability.

These can be categorised as external and internal reasonings. We should be self-reflective and work around these external forces. We might be limited in resources and constrained, but in the end it is up to us to be creative no matter our situation.


# Judging, justifying, joking

We need a safe space to be vulnerable in order to be creative - if people constantly shoot your creativity down or brush it off, it can hurt the desire to continue to create and share. Critical feedback should be invited before it is given.

Judging, justifying, and joking are are ways to protect ourselves; defence mechanisms. We need an enquiry and empathy loop when giving and receiving feedback such that it is constructive. 

We need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. We need to find ways to stimulate ourselves so we're not just stuck in autopilot. Taking breaks allows for imagination and relaxation - these things are important to build a state of mind for creativity.


# Building on ideas

We can use prompts like:
- Would it be even better if?
- Let's pretend
- How might we?
- What if?
- Yes, and

Using language like "yes, and" and "what if" can prompt you to be more positive and bring in new ideas. "Yes, but" bring necessary considerations to light, but also can change to mood negatively and cause people to not want to share. We should allow time for both mindsets but must be mindful about the language we are using in order to maintain creativity.
