# Why story map?

Working in software requires us to build something. When we build a large system, we need to figure out how to break that down into chunks. There is an inherent malleability of software, so there are many ways to build it and standards to build to. 

Waterfall can be thought of as similar to constructing a building. There are months of planning and design before the construction even begins. Once the physical building is under way, there is no use case until it is completed.

Agile development is more catered towards modern software development. Story mapping aids in delivering software geared towards user needs. We want to focus on the why. Alignment of developers, analysts, and all technologists towards the why will help us develop for the users.

Determine who the users of the system will be. We can identify some user personas. In order to develop for the users, we must first understand what their goals are. The goals can be broken down to epics, which can then be broken further down to stories. These stories can be grouped into releases for our software.
