# Introduction

In the world of professional software development, the focus is on the technical solution to problems. Apprenticeship Patterns is aimed towards software apprentices - those that are getting started in developing software and can use the guidance of seasoned professionals. It zooms out and looks at the variety of non-technical dilemmas that developers, especially those new to the field, will encounter during their time in the profession. 

A pattern is a name and description of a recurring problem and solution which could be applied to other contexts. Patterns are valuable in the journey of becoming a master in software development and craftsmanship by lightening the mental load. This book will introduce a toolkit of patterns that can be drawn upon as software craftsmen. The patterns should be applied where appropriate and combined to amplify their benefits rather than used in isolation. Find opportunities within your context to do this.

## Software Craftsmanship

The term software craftsmanship has no single interpretation. The authors of this book have conveyed it as a a community of practice underpinned by several values. These values include:

- Growth mindset. Constantly look for and work towards improvement.
- Seek feedback and adapt with it.
- Be pragmatic as opposed to dogmatic. Careful with this one as the term pragmatic has become so overused and convoluted in meaning. We want to make those trade-off decisions where we favour a solution today over a perfect future. This isn't to say that we should intentionally make it difficult to adapt to future needs. Being pragmatic requires striking the right balance.
- Share knowledge to make advancements in software development rather than saving it for oneself. This can manifest in open source software.
- Try for the sake of experimentation. Be willing to be proven wrong and learn from it. Take from failures to improve for the next experiment.
- Take charge of your future. It is your responsibility to influence your destiny. Don't just wait for someone to come along with answers.
- A focus oneself rather than the group. We're not followers of a leader of software craftsmanship, rather we are all on the same journey. We must each improve our own skills to become valuable in a team.
- Inclusiveness. The background of the software developer - whether enterprise, computer science, software engineering, or otherwise - should be celebrated and seen as an opportunity to bring in the best elements of each discipline.
- Favour skill-centric over process-centric. Not everyone is at the same skill level, but we can all improve our skills. Simply adhering to a process or using a particular tool may not garner the same results for all, due to differing levels of skill.
- Make use of situated learning. Be in the room with people that are using the skills that you want to learn. Learning from osmosis.

## Apprentice

While fellow apprentices, journeymen, and masters are valuable in being an apprentice, they are not a requirement for apprenticeship. The overarching mindset must be of that there is always a better way to do things and more learning to be done.

Being an apprentice means taking responsibility and control over the apprenticeship and the outcomes. This means that we should seek the situations and people that afford (or even force) us to learn those better ways. Look for companies, teams, and mentors that can help you in this journey.

During your time as an apprentice, intentional learning and developing craftsmanship is the primary focus. You should have little responsibility outside of this primary focus. It is important at this stage to learn how you best learn.

Eventually, the gradual improvement during the apprenticeship will culminate in a progression to a journeyman. This transition can be seen by added responsibilities and expectations outside of just learning. 

## Journeyman

A journeyman is still focused on learning and improving their craft, but an additional focus is introduced. That is to make and improve connections between those in the craft. Intrateam communications should be refined. This responsibility will expand to also include mentoring apprentices and connecting with the industry at large.

As a journeyman, responsibilities are greater and failures can be less forgiving. Despite this, one must build on their craftsmanship by building a diverse and richer portfolio of applications. One should seek to become recognised in their community as a valuable player.

## Master

At mastery, a practitioner would use their skills and knowledge to enhance that of others while also encompassing the roles of an apprentice and a journeyman. The master amplifies the skills of the people around them. A master would propel the industry forward by creating new ways of working e.g. tools that change the way software developers do their work. They would also play a key role in training journeymen to become masters in their own right and more.

## Apprenticeship

The clich√© apprenticeship involves a young aspiring craftsman working in a blacksmith shop under an experienced master. The apprentice cleans around the shop and is sometimes involved in the forging process, but is constantly keeping an eye on what the master is doing and learning from the work being done. The apprentice becomes more involved and eventually becomes skilled enough to open their own shop, make a living, and become a master blacksmith.

The modern apprenticeship, while drawing similarities from its roots, is much different. It is more focused on the mindset of recognising that the apprentice is near the beginning of their journey as a craftsman and being prepared to take the opportunities provided to create their apprenticeship.

Most newcomers into the software industry will not have a formal apprenticeship and will have to make the most of their circumstances. They may face incompetent management, disengaged colleagues, relentless delivery pressure, and generally poor work environments.

Apprenticeship requires actively seeking opportunities to learn. It means finding skilled developers to learn from and work alongside. It requires a desire to be more than just competent developer and to instead be a software craftsman.


# Chapter 2: Emptying the Cup

The title comes from a young philosopher visiting a famed Zen master to learn, but the young philosopher kept cutting the master short in his teachings to talk about his own experiences. The Zen master pours the young philosopher a cup of tea, but keeps pouring, until the young philosopher exclaims "the cup is already full and overflowing"! The Zen master responds that he can't give the young philosopher a drink if his cup is already full.

This chapter focuses on creating an open mind (having an empty cup), ready to receive knowledge (to be filled).

## Your First Language

At first, you will only be vaguely familiar with one or two programming languages. Your job requires you to write code in a specific programming language to the same quality of your team. If you don't have a job yet, getting one requires some fluency in a particular language.

**Solution**

Choose a main programming language to become proficient in. It should become your default language you use to write solutions and practice with. Take into account the availability of experts around you when choosing a first language. Build toy applications using the language you chose. Ask for guidance from more experienced developers when stuck - this can save you hours, but don't become dependent on this help as it won't always be available.

When learning your first language, find an actual problem to solve rather than using tiny snippet examples with no correlation. Find opportunities for feedback loops. Smaller feedback loops are good for seeing progression - once comfortable enough with the language, use test-driven development to constantly create these small feedback loops. You can write tests to check your knowledge of standard language features and constructs, then move to testing library implementation, and finally of your solution logic and code.

Don't get stuck with just the first language - each language has different strengths and weaknesses and one can be more suited than another for a particular solution. Your first language is a base and framework for you to learn other languages.

## The White Belt

Once you have a deep understanding in your first language, you will find that your team will recognise your competence and may call upon it. While proud of your skills, you may find it difficult to learn further and your acquisition of new skills may have slowed.

**Solution**

Putting on the white belt means to set previous learnings aside, take a "not knowing" stance, and learn from the black belt. In practical terms this means, instead of believing you are an expert, suspend your regular programming habits and idioms to allow the discovery of new ones. Temporarily sacrifice productivity in favour of improving your skills, ultimately leading to further productivity once the new skills are honed.

Find opportunities to "unlearn" something - situations that force you to set aside previous experiences and learn new paradigms. Is your first language object-oriented? Try solving the same problem using a functional language. You can apply this pattern outside of languages too - extend it to technology stacks for example. Find an expert in a new paradigm and ask them to explain the things that are different to your typical paradigm.

## Unleash Your Enthusiasm

As an apprentice, your enthusiasm for software development is at its highest. You have high curiosity and are excited about it all. You may find that your team has less of these attributes as they are further along in their journey, causing you to hold back and refrain from expressing this enthusiasm.

**Solution**

Your enthusiasm is actually beneficial to the team. You bring attributes that will accelerate your learning but can also increase the performance of your team. Software teams, like any other group, will lean towards conforming to their established norms. They get focused on delivering features and solving problems.

Apply this pattern situationally - not all teams are receptive to newcomers and new ideas. They may treat your ignorance as incompetence rather than a desire to learn. However, in a team that is receptive, you can impart your excitement and enthusiasm onto the more experienced developers.

While you may not have the same knowledge or productivity as the established members of the team, you have a responsibility to utilise your inexperience and fresh perspective. Ask all the questions and make suggestions for improvement - often the reason why things are done the way the are is because they always have been done that way. Propose new ideas that would improve the team- worst case, the feedback and flaws pointed out will help your comprehension and understanding.

## Concrete Skills

Part of software craftmanship is to constantly seek environments with better learning opportunities. This means surrounding yourself with other craftsmen who are more skilled than you are. Unfortunately, there is no incentive to risk hiring a candidate that may not be able to contribute in delivering on the team's workload.

**Solution**

Develop concrete skills which you can demonstrate. Some of these skills are more rudimentary in that they will allow you to bypass the buzzword bingo filters, while others show that you be of benefit the team. 

Concrete skills can be proficiency in your first language and its standard libraries, DevOps knowledge, and experience with popular frameworks. The more of these discrete skills you possess, the more confidence a team can have in your ability to contribute directly and indirectly to the team. 

You must possess enough concrete skills to justify the risk that the hiring manager takes in choosing you.

## Expose Your Ignorance

As an apprentice working for an organisation, you are still depended upon, in some capacity, to deliver value. You aren't familiar with the problem at hand and some of the technologies being used.

**Solution**

While you may want to appear competent, you know that you have areas of ignorance and inexperience. Demonstrate to the managers and team that you are dependable, even when deep in the learning process. Show them that growth and learning is integral to delivering software. 

Don't cave to the pressures of software delivery - there will always be more work to do. Instead, tell the truth - that you're in the learning process and understanding what is required. Create confidence in your ability to learn, rather than by telling them you know things that you don't.

Exposing your ignorance is most easily manifested by asking questions. More experienced developers will assume knowledge as certain skills and technologies have become second-nature for them. You can accelerate your progression to a journeyman by asking questions directly.

Do not shy away from exposing your ignorance. This can lead to become an expert in particular technologies but not a craftsman - experts will stick around in familiar territories of technologies, while craftsmen will work with many different technologies throughout their journey, gaining more expertise and indeed preference for some.

## Confront Your Ignorance

All throughout your journey, you will come to recognise gaps in your skills which are necessary for your work. These gaps may be skills that your team already possesses and expect the same of you.

**Solution**

Select one of the gaps you have discovered and actively learn in order to fill that gap. Acquiring this skill can be done in your preferred learning style, even if as simply as asking an expert and working together using the skill.

You can also fill gaps in private without exposing your ignorance, but be careful not to create a culture that discourages failure. Learning in public can often be preferable as it creates teaching opportunities.

On the flip side, you can also expose your ignorance without confronting it. Avoid this as you'll come to depend on your team to cover for your gaps and become genuinely ignorant (rather than being ignorant only to show desire to learn).

## The Deep End

Incremental learning is great, until it isn't. The small steps can be unsatisfying and lead to mediocrity as you never move to the next level. You need to add to your toolkit, improve your confidence, and have work that you are proud of and can talk about. You have a desire for new challenges, bigger projects, or increased complexity.

**Solution**

Jump at any opportunity to develop and flex some new muscles. You may not feel entirely ready, but you may well never feel ready, so when the opportunity arises, take it. The challenge comes with risk, but this is where growth happens - when you're stretched. Be prepared to fail, but don't lie about your capability in order to secure the opportunity.

This pattern should not be applied with a sense of recklessness - instead, it should be brave or rising up to the challenge. Reduce the risks by using patterns like Finding Mentors and Kindred Spirits, ensuring you have a support network in place before diving into the deep end. Create Feedback Loops to ensure you're staying on track and can get help when you need it.

## Retreat Into Competence

You may find yourself underwater where, for whatever reason, things aren't working. Whether because you don't know enough or you've taken a challenge too big to tackle.

**Solution**

Temporarily retreat into a safe area where you have established competence. Build something in that safe area and recognise the abilities that you have developed in your journey to date. This is similar to taking one step back in order to take several steps forward. Be sure to actually take those steps forward as soon as possible - rebound quickly from the step back.

Limit the use of this pattern using appropriate limits - timebox each usage to ensure that you do not retreat too far or too long. Get support from those around you where needed to bounce back sooner.


# Chapter 3: Walking the Long Road

This chapter is all about taking the lifelong software craftsmanship journey one step at a time. Surround yourself with people that are constantly learning and be in the learning process. Exceptional software developers will always be on the long road of learning.

## The Long Road

Society has moved towards instant gratification. In the software development realm, this manifests in industry fads. These fads tend to repeat mistakes that have already been made by previous generations of software developers because that knowledge is lost.

You want to become a master software craftsman and build up your skills, knowledge, and competence over time. However, societal norms also pressure you to seek the highest paying jobs, push for promotions, and be on the biggest projects.

**Solution**

Realise that the craftsmanship journey may stray from convention, but stay the course. You know where you want to be in the long term - focus on the learning and growth opportunities that will get you there instead of maximising salary and rushing to move into leadership roles.

The aspiration to become a master software craftsman requires long-term planning. All of the competencies and relationships take time to develop. Set these expectations for yourself early. Eventually though, you'll find that you will have the knowledge which surpasses any one technology  or implementation - you'll understand the core of the problem and realise that most new technologies solve the same fundamental problems.

While you won't have set out to become a CTO or filthy rich, along the way you will certainly find yourself in roles with great responsibility and with appropriate compensation. These things may signify a successful journey through apprenticeship, but they simply by-products rather than the end goal.

This pattern isn't to invalidate the different paths that people in this industry can take. It simply describes the road that this book advocates for. 

## Craft over Art

Your job is to build solutions to solve problems. There are existing, proven solutions but the problem affords you an opportunity to develop something new and impressive.

**Solution**

A craft is an art, but not a fine art. It produces artefacts that, primarily, are useful. Any decorative aspects are secondary, unlike in fine art where the artefact is produced solely for beauty. Crafted solutions can be beautiful, but more importantly, they must be useful.

Your craftsmanship exists to build solutions for others, not to express artistic ability. You must place the interests of your customer above your own development and showing off your skills. Only this way will you advance as a craftsman, where building and maintaining relationships is key. If your creations are too beautiful and not useful enough, then you are no longer in the craft.

Craftsmen must produce artefacts even when they are not in the mood or dislike the concepts. They can't wait until artistic inspiration is high. Their customers depend on satisfactory solutions that provide value.

Part of this pattern is the balancing of providing satisfactory solutions and producing artefacts which meet or exceed a baseline level of quality. The more useful a solution is, the more quality it should have. Except it takes time to reach the desired level of quality, so repeated compromises will be made throughout the lifecycle of the solution. Sometimes the wrong compromise may be made, requiring refactoring of the previous work.

## Sustainable Motivations

 Through your time as an apprentice, you have a goal to develop your technical skills. However, the reality of the projects that you work in may be tedious, frustrating, chaotic, or generally non-conducive to keeping you motivated.

**Solution**

Ensure that your commitment to and motivation for software craftsmanship can be sustained in the long term. You will have extraordinary days, weeks, or even months where your job is awesome. You'll love the work that you're doing, yet you get paid for it.

Outside of these periods, you'll find monotony or face tedious business problems that are poorly defined and are needlessly complicated. You'll be held back by endless bureaucracy, mismatching personalities, and difficult leadership. During these phases, it is especially important to have motivations to stay within the craft.

You may be motivated purely by money and find yourself climbing the corporate ladder rather than focusing on the craft, but also wish to maintain your technical reputation. You keep working through despite some adverse aspects of the job, with the job eventually improving.

You could also find motivation in making the best financial decision - you may be thinking of leaving the craft due to a lack of enjoyment, but it would be financially irresponsible to leave at the moment. You endure the lull period and rekindle the passion and enjoyment.

Be careful that your motivations don't trap your progression towards mastery - you may be motivated by money, and your current skillset may be lucrative, but it could hold you back from achieving greater things and reaching a higher level of craftsmanship.

## Nurture Your Passion

Your job is to write code, but the work environment may not enable you to be a software craftsman and reduces your passion for it.

**Solution**

Put things in place to help retain your passion. Work on things that you like. If you don't have the time to do so within work, find time outside of work to. Find like-minded people - get involved with user groups, blogs, forums etc.

Set boundaries on what you will work with. When these boundaries are tested, make conscious decisions to apply your principles e.g. working only the hours that you are comfortable with, maintaining your minimum code quality standards, excusing yourself from situations like abusive meetings or conversations. You may not be popular for these things, but you'll retain your passion for and longevity in the craft.

## Draw Your Own Map

Each organisation offers a subset of all of the possible career paths that you may take. Your employer may not provide a path which fits for you.

**Solution**

It is your responsibility to figure out your career direction, the next step you take, and getting where you want to be. Identify what that step is - make it ambitious, but also logical. Then, figure out how you'll get there with smaller steps and what you need to do.

The smaller steps will be vital in getting the ball rolling and achieving your end goal. You can also get specific help along the way with smaller feedback cycles. Continually assess your map as you progress and as your vision changes. If you find that you and your employer's differences are hindering your ability to take the next step, look for new opportunities.

## Use Your Title

Through your journey as an apprentice and journeyman, you'll find yourself in jobs with titles like `Senior`, `Principal`, `Architect`, or `Lead`. You may feel as though you aren't that person. You feel as though you need to justify differences between your job title and your skills.

**Solution**

Your title is not who you are.

These more senior titles do not mean that your apprenticeship or time as a journeyman is over. The opposite may also occur - you may not have receive the recognition in surpassing colleagues in the form of a job title. In both cases, the title reflects how your organisation perceives you and your fit.

Figure out what it is that you do - write your own job description which expands upon your job title. Keep it updated and accurate to what it is that you actually do and what skills you possess. Think about how this description would look to someone outside of your role.

## Stay in the Trenches

Similar to [Use Your Title](#use-your-title), you may be rewarded with promotions as you progress through your software craftsmanship journey. These new roles may lead you away from the tools.

**Solution**

Do not be fooled when you are offered a management position - you will not be able to remain a technical manager for long. As a manager, you will not have the time to keep programming, taking you away from the craft.

If you wish to stay in the craft, find or create opportunities to retain your technical skills whilst still moving up the chain e.g. technical leadership like consulting within the organisation. When offered up a promotion that you're not particularly interested in, you have a position to negotiate other rewards which better align with your desire to remain a software craftsman - not necessarily in monetary form, but also in reduced contractual constraints for example.

## A Different Road

You have followed the journey you created using [Draw Your Own Map](#draw-your-own-map), but it has led you astray from [The Long Road](#the-long-road).

**Solution**

You may not stay within the craft and veer away from the road, whether temporarily or permanently. That's okay. Keep following your own map, but retain what you learned throughout your apprenticeship. Do the things that you want to do in life.


# Chapter 4: Accurate Self-Assessment

Learning quickly is good, but don't stagnate. Being slightly ahead of the curve isn't enough - that's a common occurrence in software development and leads to mediocrity. If you are the biggest fish in a small pond, seek out ponds with bigger fish.

Realise that your competence is only within the realm of how far you have walked along [The Long Road](#the-long-road) so far. Find teams, organisations, and master craftsmen that are have a working proficiency higher than your imagination. Become better than you were the day before.

## Be the Worst

You have become one of the, if not the most, competent within your team or organisation. You've outgrown your environment and are no longer learning at your desired pace.

**Solution**

Find a new environment where you are the weakest member of the team. You have the most to learn when there are better developers around you.

Stronger team members will improve your productivity and increase your pace of learning massively - they'll teach you in ways where you will avoid making certain mistakes and will guide you out when you do make mistakes. These learnings are less apparent when you're working with the team, but when you go to work as an individual, you'll realise how far they've brought you and how much you've learned.

Take opportunities to build [Breakable Toys](#breakable-toys) in order to step back from the help of your team. Reflect on your learnings from all the [Rubbing Elbows](#rubbing-elbows) with your team.

Remember that as the weakest member in your team, it is your goal to become stronger. This means that you may have to work harder than everyone else. Always look for ways to improve and learn from the team. Eventually, you'll find yourself at the same level as or surpassing your team.

Don't drag your team down. Look for any opportunity to add value to the team, even if it is using the [Sweep the Floor](#sweep-the-floor) pattern and doing tedious tasks. Develop [Concrete Skills](#concrete-skills), as eventually these are the things that the team requires of you. They are taking the risk of hiring you in hopes that you will contribute more and more.

## Find Mentors

Know that you are not the only one that has gone through your current stage of the journey. You may be spending a lot of time looking for information or solving a problem that is trivial to those that have already experienced it. You're delving into a path with no guidance and are not sure where to go from there.

**Solution**

Look for people that have walked this path already. You can learn from them. Remember that we are all at different stages down the journey, and when you find a mentor, they are also at a certain point. They may not know everything, and you may eventually outgrow that mentor and not be able to learn much further from them.

It can be difficult to find a mentor. They may not be interested in mentoring, or they may not have the capacity. You can be a mentor to those that are earlier on in their apprenticeship journey.

## Kindred Spirits

Organisations with a culture that encourage and support software craftsmanship are rare. Your organisation may be discouraging and non-conducive to your software craftsmanship journey. You may find yourself stranded amongst people that are not interested in the journey and lack mentors to guide you.

**Solution**

Look for like-minded people. Walking [The Long Road](#the-long-road) isn't a solitary journey. The relationship with Kindred Spirits is different to that of mentors - it is a peer relationship where you share things together and learn together. Mentees may default to using the same technologies and skills that mentors use, whereas Kindred Spirits will teach each other the things that they have discovered.

Find a community and get the benefits of camaraderie. Be careful not to lean too much into the hive mind, though. You'll want to dissent when you have a differing opinion - not in a disrespectful way, but to challenge the thinking and come up with new ideas. How the community reacts to such new ideas is a good gauge as to whether it is a good place for learning.

## Rubbing Elbows

Mentors and kindred spirits are great, but the relationships likely exist outside of the workplace. When you're at work, you work without them by your side. You may find that your productivity and learning has slowed; that there are better approaches out there that you haven't been exposed to.

**Solution**

Pair with other developers and work on something together. You will learn nuances that cannot be learned outside of sitting and accomplishing a task together. These incidental learning opportunities must be created by you initiating pairing sessions.

Pair programming is not aways effectively implemented. You'll find yourself lost compared to your pair and not knowing how to contribute. In these instances, ask questions. Ask to slow down and get explanations for parts that you don't understand. If the same pairing partner constantly causes you to feel lost, look for opportunities to pair with someone else.

## Sweep the Floor

When you start your first job or project, or even just enter a different job or project, you'll inevitably have less context than others. You may be unsure of yourself and how to contribute, and the team may also be unsure of you. You want to contribute and earn favour within the team.

**Solution**

Volunteer yourself for the menial tasks that others seem to not want to do. Do a good job of the task, even if the result seems trivial. It still adds value to the team. You'll also find that often the unglamorous tasks end up being the most vital. They are a great learning opportunity as they may not be taught in academia, and the experience is valuable.

Tasks like maintenance, bug fixes, code review, refactoring technical debt, and documentation are all things that need to be done. Look for tasks that are at the edge and pose less risk.

Do not trap yourself into a role of only doing these tasks. They're great for when you're new to a team or project, but eventually you need to delve deeper and zoom out into the bigger picture of the project.


# Chapter 5: Perpetual Learning

Learning is at the core of apprenticeship, and the mark of a successful apprentice is in utilising their learning ability. An apprentice must continually learn, even when faced with complexities and challenges at work. In addition to learning new skills, they must also learn how to learn. Upon progressing to a journeyman, or even mastery, one must set aside their expertise in order to open up opportunities to learn a new domain.

The patterns in this chapter focus on how to learn and how to improve that learning. Use them throughout your career as you see fit. They will all help with exposing new information and gaining new knowledge.

## Expand Your Bandwidth

As an apprentice, you will pick up basic skills early on in your day-to-day work. However, these skills will be low-level and focused only on what you have worked on, giving a narrow understanding of software development.

**Solution**

Information is absorbed by the apprentice initially at a slow and steady rate, though it may seem like a torrent. With such a vast amount of information available in the craft, at some point the apprentice must traverse the expanse.

Apprentices must expand their ability to take in this information - they must be disciplined and develop techniques that help them to understand information, as well as retain and apply it.

The pattern requires apprentices to seek out information and knowledge from multiple, varied mediums e.g. blogs, Twitter, mailing lists, user groups, conferences, books, and other online resources. It means engaging with these resources in deeper ways than simply reading it and forgetting about it.

Once you have developed the techniques to Expand Your Bandwidth, you must understand when to apply the pattern. There is a trade-off between consuming the wealth of information available and software development time. Too much learning time means little development time. Strike the right balance given your current workload and context.

## Practice, Practice, Practice

Your day to day programming activities require you to minimise mistakes, but you want to develop your existing skills and form new [Concrete Skills](#concrete-skills).

**Solution**

Set aside time for intentional practice in a safe environment where you are able to make mistakes freely.

The concept of a code kata is to create a practice exercise where you are removed from stresses like release deadlines, production incidents, distractions, and interruptions. Instead, you're placed an environment created specifically for you to practice your craft.

These exercises can be simple and generic, or more complex and niched. The point is, you are able to relax and take the time to discover nuances of the craft that you may not have the opportunity to discover in production codebases. You can do the kata repeatedly in different ways. You are free to try different techniques and learn the advantages and disadvantages. 

Seek out these exercises or create your own. Ensure that it's not so simple that you can't learn anything, but not so difficult that you can't solve it. Solve the exercise several times, noting the differences in your solutions over time.

## Breakable Toys

Your work environment is not suitable for failing - the consequences are high. Except some things are best learned through trying and failing. You must attempt bold solutions and learn from mistakes in order to become a craftsman capable of succeeding in the face of difficult problems.

**Solution**

Create "toy" systems that are similar in tech (but not scope) to the systems you build at work. You can also build toy systems that have no relevance to the tech you use at work. The systems could be useful to you e.g. a personal wiki, note bank etc. You can cater your solutions to suit your personal needs, perhaps even better than a generic off-the-shelf solution.

The point is, these projects provide you with systems to try new things on and are comfortable with failing in as you're the only one impacted by any downtime. These toys can be carried with you throughout your career, agnostic of any employment changes. Ensure that you maintain your high software craftsmanship standards. The projects can embody your craft.

## Use the Source

The code is the single source of truth in software; the author's intent for the piece of software may differ, but the code is what actually determines the behaviour. Using the [Practice, Practice, Practice](#practice-practice-practice) pattern in isolation can lead to the formation of bad habits that you may not even be aware of. You need good examples that you can refer to and learn from.

**Solution**

Read other people's code. Read the code behind the tools and applications that you use. In doing this, you can emulate their coding practices and begin to understand the thought processes behind the code. You'll come to realise that the people that built these tools and applications were also once apprentices, and are not inherently better than you or special compared to you. Reading code well is a skill that is instrumental to optimising your work day.

Download open source projects and go through the version history. You'll discover decisions that were made by examining the structure of the codebase. Try to refactor a piece of the code and figure out why these decisions were made. At some point you may find a decision that you disagree with. Try to determine if there is a missing piece of information either on your side or the author's.

You should also find people that are willing to read your code. They can provide another perspective and feedback - be sure to filter out their personal behaviours that may not be in the best software craftsmanship principles. Do the same for other people - sharing code and learning together is valuable.

Join teams that practice pair programming and code reviews. If your team doesn't already, you can try implement these practices if they are willing. Academia glosses over the fact that programmers will spend more time reading code than writing it. Every piece of code that you read can teach you something, whether it is good or bad code. You'll learn the idioms and subtleties of languages, as well as pick up new tricks (e.g. data structures, algorithms) that you can apply in your code. 

## Reflect As You Work

Through your working career, you'll find yourself being promoted to roles higher up the ladder. As you move up, you may remain waiting for the day that you actually feel experienced.

**Solution**

Regularly reflect on your work. Think about the practices that you use - are they novel and innovative, or are they dated and becoming obsolete? Are there things in your team that you especially like or dislike? How did these things come to be and how can they be retained or improved?

You can also reflect on other people around you - by observing and reflecting on the journeymen and master craftsmen you work with, you can glean practices that they use. You can discover those novel and innovative practices and techniques by watching those around you.

## Record What You Learn

You may learn the same thing more than once, but it doesn't stick. You recall doing these things but you don't know the finer details.

**Solution**

Form some kind of written record of your software craftsmanship journey - a journal, wiki, or blog. This record will always exist for you to refer back to. If your record exists publicly, you may even get links to your own resources when you use a search engine. It can also help others facing similar situations.

The records should be treated as a living resource - regularly reflect on the lessons and thoughts that you note down. Review what you've written, make new connections, and re-establish practices that you may have forgotten.

## Share What You Learn

Once you are further into your apprenticeship, the experience that you've gained becomes valuable to others and you become a source of knowledge. Your focus as a craftsman has been on yourself, but to become a journeyman you need to be effective at communicating with others and bringing them up to speed.

**Solution**

Get into the habit of sharing your lessons. Write a blog, run brown bags, make presentations at conferences, write tutorials etc. These things aren't easy, especially as an apprentice, but you'll come to realise that other apprentices value this kind of sharing. You have similar levels of experience to them and have the opportunity to demystify complexity for your peers without assuming prior knowledge that more experienced developers may take for granted.

Be careful not to share things that shouldn't be shared - for example trade secrets, or lessons learned from your team members or employer that they'd prefer kept in a tighter circle.

## Create Feedback Loops

You don't know if you're experiencing "[unconscious incompetence]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence))" or not - you may not recognise that you are lacking a particular set of skills. You also find it difficult to gauge your own skill and the skill of those around you. Whether you succeed or fail is often a mystery and the outcome comes as a surprise.

Your ability to assess yourself is relative to your previous self - it lacks objectivity as there is no external comparison. Your view of your own abilities can be skewed in either direction.

**Solution**

Create mechanisms for regular, external, objective feedback. This feedback should be timely, regular, and effective such that you can become conscious of your incompetence sooner.

There are several levels of feedback mechanisms. At a low level, there's test-driven-development, typed languages with interactive interpreters, and tools like IntelliSense and ReSharper. Another level includes code reviews and pair programming. You could also explicitly ask people how they think you're doing and their opinion - e.g. from interviewers.

The other side of the feedback loop is for you to process the information. You must receive and filter the useful feedback out from the fluff. You can also get bad feedback that is well-meaning, but is actually discouraging or outdated e.g. don't do this, you'll never succeed if you do this, do this because that's what I did when I was your age.

Useful feedback is actionable. You can do something or change a behaviour accordingly. Feedback can encourage you to do more of something or do less of something. A successful apprentice creates small feedback loops such that they can make these small adjustments.

An apprentice must withhold from defending their current knowledge such that they can listen without interrupting what is being taught.

## Learn How You Fail

Failure happens. If you don't fail, you're not pushing your boundaries enough or you're not recognising your mistakes. As an apprentice, your successes will expand as you learn, but you may still have weaknesses that have been left unattended.

**Solution**

Actively look out for the ways that you are failing and try to address those that are worth fixing. Learn about the things that lead you to failure - certain patterns, behaviours, conditions, habits etc. Some failures need to be accepted - they may be things that you're just not good at, or that the time invested in fixing them are too great for what benefit you'd get.


# Chapter 6: Construct Your Curriculum

Information is abundant. The Internet brings a wealth of knowledge, but there are some pieces of information that are best found in books. You should supplement blogs, articles, tutorials etc. with books. There are no assigned books for your apprenticeship because it's *your* apprenticeship - you need to find the books that will help you the most in your journey and construct your own curriculum.

## Reading List

You've had a bit of experience, but you've also discovered how much information is out there that you still need to learn. You're finding books to read faster than you can read them.

**Solution**

Keep a list of the books that you want to read. This doesn't serve just as a prioritisation list, but you can also reflect on your past readings and identify any patterns and gaps in your learning. Books will refer to other books - those that you see often are probably worth prioritising. Some books will also recommend a whole list of books - these lists are especially valuable as a starting point when you're not sure what to read.

Often you'll need knowledge to understand which order you should read certain books. It's paradoxical in that you need to read the books to gain that knowledge. To solve this, start with a book which approaches the topic with a broader lens, and then read more specialist books as you see fit.

## Read Constantly

There are so many fundamental concepts that you can't possibly know them all as an apprentice. You may be proficient in some, but others elude you.

**Solution**

Consume as much written content as you possibly can, with emphasis on books over blogs or other content. When you have the opportunity and capacity to read more books, take it - these are the things that will distinguish you from a mediocre programmer. Being consistent is key - reading a book every month or two adds up to a wealth of knowledge over time. Keep a book on hand such that you can fill in the little bits of time you have throughout the day with reading.

## Study the Classics

Your education may not have covered the theory books that are widely read - the books that experienced people around you regularly refer to.

**Solution**

Note down when a concept is brought up and ask what book it's from. Note it down in your [Reading List](#reading-list). 

Be careful not to get stuck into only classics - some may withstand the test of time, while others were contemporary when written but are no longer relevant. Mix in more modern content alongside the classics that have aged well.

## Dig Deeper

At work, your delivery obligations mean that you only do enough research to get the job done. You make decisions without the full knowledge surrounding the tool - instead simply getting by using the examples provided. You learn just enough about a system to get your part done.

Maintenance of your code becomes increasingly more difficult because of these decisions made with little knowledge. Corners were cut and technical debt has amassed. The superficial knowledge gained during implementation is insufficient to triage small bugs or when deeper knowledge is required. You may not even realise how little you know until you're put to the test.

**Solution**

Acquire deeper knowledge in the tools and technologies that you are using. You should understand why the things are the way that they are - why is it designed in the way that it is. Digging deeper means that you'll be able to explain deeper than just the surface of the systems you're working with. It'll distinguish you as a candidate during interview processes. It'll set you up to build software that lasts.

One way to dig deeper is to go to primary sources. Often information is lost in translation, including the original intentions and problems that were being targeted. Cut out the middlemen and go read specifications, RFCs, etc.

Applying this pattern regularly will set you apart you from other programmers. You'll truly understand how your tools work. You'll be selected for more complex problems - this means you'll shine brighter but also likely fail more often. Use this as an opportunity to apply the [Be Your Worst](#be-your-worst) pattern.

## Familiar Tools

Every engagement you are on will have it's own nuances, tools, technologies etc. Working on a project will involve new colleagues, roles, business domains etc. Within all this, you need some consistency and reliability so that you can provide good estimates with your work.

**Solution**

Familiarise yourself with a set of tools; know the ins and outs of these tools. They become your toolkit that is portable with you across jobs, projects, and organisations. These tools make you the most productive when you're on a new engagement - you already know what to do when you face certain issues.

Don't become completely reliant on these tools, however. Sometimes the best tool for the job isn't one that you're familiar with. and you'll use the same tool for every job. You may even find that your tool is no longer useful as they've been rendered obsolete by a newer tool. Ensure to update your toolbox.
