# Introduction

In the world of professional software development, the focus is on the technical solution to problems. Apprenticeship Patterns is aimed towards software apprentices - those that are getting started in developing software and can use the guidance of seasoned professionals. It zooms out and looks at the variety of non-technical dilemmas that developers, especially those new to the field, will encounter during their time in the profession. 

A pattern is a name and description of a recurring problem and solution which could be applied to other contexts. Patterns are valuable in the journey of becoming a master in software development and craftsmanship by lightening the mental load. This book will introduce a toolkit of patterns that can be drawn upon as software craftsmen. The patterns should be applied where appropriate and combined to amplify their benefits rather than used in isolation. Find opportunities within your context to do this.

## Software Craftsmanship

The term software craftsmanship has no single interpretation. The authors of this book have conveyed it as a a community of practice underpinned by several values. These values include:

- Growth mindset. Constantly look for and work towards improvement.
- Seek feedback and adapt with it.
- Be pragmatic as opposed to dogmatic. Careful with this one as the term pragmatic has become so overused and convoluted in meaning. We want to make those trade-off decisions where we favour a solution today over a perfect future. This isn't to say that we should intentionally make it difficult to adapt to future needs. Being pragmatic requires striking the right balance.
- Share knowledge to make advancements in software development rather than saving it for oneself. This can manifest in open source software.
- Try for the sake of experimentation. Be willing to be proven wrong and learn from it. Take from failures to improve for the next experiment.
- Take charge of your future. It is your responsibility to influence your destiny. Don't just wait for someone to come along with answers.
- A focus oneself rather than the group. We're not followers of a leader of software craftsmanship, rather we are all on the same journey. We must each improve our own skills to become valuable in a team.
- Inclusiveness. The background of the software developer - whether enterprise, computer science, software engineering, or otherwise - should be celebrated and seen as an opportunity to bring in the best elements of each discipline.
- Favour skill-centric over process-centric. Not everyone is at the same skill level, but we can all improve our skills. Simply adhering to a process or using a particular tool may not garner the same results for all, due to differing levels of skill.
- Make use of situated learning. Be in the room with people that are using the skills that you want to learn. Learning from osmosis.

## Apprentice

While fellow apprentices, journeymen, and masters are valuable in being an apprentice, they are not a requirement for apprenticeship. The overarching mindset must be of that there is always a better way to do things and more learning to be done.

Being an apprentice means taking responsibility and control over the apprenticeship and the outcomes. This means that we should seek the situations and people that afford (or even force) us to learn those better ways. Look for companies, teams, and mentors that can help you in this journey.

During your time as an apprentice, intentional learning and developing craftsmanship is the primary focus. You should have little responsibility outside of this primary focus. It is important at this stage to learn how you best learn.

Eventually, the gradual improvement during the apprenticeship will culminate in a progression to a journeyman. This transition can be seen by added responsibilities and expectations outside of just learning. 

## Journeyman

A journeyman is still focused on learning and improving their craft, but an additional focus is introduced. That is to make and improve connections between those in the craft. Intrateam communications should be refined. This responsibility will expand to also include mentoring apprentices and connecting with the industry at large.

As a journeyman, responsibilities are greater and failures can be less forgiving. Despite this, one must build on their craftsmanship by building a diverse and richer portfolio of applications. One should seek to become recognised in their community as a valuable player.

## Master

At mastery, a practitioner would use their skills and knowledge to enhance that of others while also encompassing the roles of an apprentice and a journeyman. The master amplifies the skills of the people around them. A master would propel the industry forward by creating new ways of working e.g. tools that change the way software developers do their work. They would also play a key role in training journeymen to become masters in their own right and more.

## Apprenticeship

The clich√© apprenticeship involves a young aspiring craftsman working in a blacksmith shop under an experienced master. The apprentice cleans around the shop and is sometimes involved in the forging process, but is constantly keeping an eye on what the master is doing and learning from the work being done. The apprentice becomes more involved and eventually becomes skilled enough to open their own shop, make a living, and become a master blacksmith.

The modern apprenticeship, while drawing similarities from its roots, is much different. It is more focused on the mindset of recognising that the apprentice is near the beginning of their journey as a craftsman and being prepared to take the opportunities provided to create their apprenticeship.

Most newcomers into the software industry will not have a formal apprenticeship and will have to make the most of their circumstances. They may face incompetent management, disengaged colleagues, relentless delivery pressure, and generally poor work environments.

Apprenticeship requires actively seeking opportunities to learn. It means finding skilled developers to learn from and work alongside. It requires a desire to be more than just competent developer and to instead be a software craftsman.


# Chapter 2: Emptying the Cup

The title comes from a young philosopher visiting a famed Zen master to learn, but the young philosopher kept cutting the master short in his teachings to talk about his own experiences. The Zen master pours the young philosopher a cup of tea, but keeps pouring, until the young philosopher exclaims "the cup is already full and overflowing"! The Zen master responds that he can't give the young philosopher a drink if his cup is already full.

This chapter focuses on creating an open mind (having an empty cup), ready to receive knowledge (to be filled).

## Your First Language

At first, you will only be vaguely familiar with one or two programming languages. Your job requires you to write code in a specific programming language to the same quality of your team. If you don't have a job yet, getting one requires some fluency in a particular language.

**Solution**

Choose a main programming language to become proficient in. It should become your default language you use to write solutions and practice with. Take into account the availability of experts around you when choosing a first language. Build toy applications using the language you chose. Ask for guidance from more experienced developers when stuck - this can save you hours, but don't become dependent on this help as it won't always be available.

When learning your first language, find an actual problem to solve rather than using tiny snippet examples with no correlation. Find opportunities for feedback loops. Smaller feedback loops are good for seeing progression - once comfortable enough with the language, use test-driven development to constantly create these small feedback loops. You can write tests to check your knowledge of standard language features and constructs, then move to testing library implementation, and finally of your solution logic and code.

Don't get stuck with just the first language - each language has different strengths and weaknesses and one can be more suited than another for a particular solution. Your first language is a base and framework for you to learn other languages.

## The White Belt

Once you have a deep understanding in your first language, you will find that your team will recognise your competence and may call upon it. While proud of your skills, you may find it difficult to learn further and your acquisition of new skills may have slowed.

**Solution**

Putting on the white belt means to set previous learnings aside, take a "not knowing" stance, and learn from the black belt. In practical terms this means, instead of believing you are an expert, suspend your regular programming habits and idioms to allow the discovery of new ones. Temporarily sacrifice productivity in favour of improving your skills, ultimately leading to further productivity once the new skills are honed.

Find opportunities to "unlearn" something - situations that force you to set aside previous experiences and learn new paradigms. Is your first language object-oriented? Try solving the same problem using a functional language. You can apply this pattern outside of languages too - extend it to technology stacks for example. Find an expert in a new paradigm and ask them to explain the things that are different to your typical paradigm.

## Unleash Your Enthusiasm

As an apprentice, your enthusiasm for software development is at its highest. You have high curiosity and are excited about it all. You may find that your team has less of these attributes as they are further along in their journey, causing you to hold back and refrain from expressing this enthusiasm.

**Solution**

Your enthusiasm is actually beneficial to the team. You bring attributes that will accelerate your learning but can also increase the performance of your team. Software teams, like any other group, will lean towards conforming to their established norms. They get focused on delivering features and solving problems.

Apply this pattern situationally - not all teams are receptive to newcomers and new ideas. They may treat your ignorance as incompetence rather than a desire to learn. However, in a team that is receptive, you can impart your excitement and enthusiasm onto the more experienced developers.

While you may not have the same knowledge or productivity as the established members of the team, you have a responsibility to utilise your inexperience and fresh perspective. Ask all the questions and make suggestions for improvement - often the reason why things are done the way the are is because they always have been done that way. Propose new ideas that would improve the team- worst case, the feedback and flaws pointed out will help your comprehension and understanding.

## Concrete Skills

Part of software craftmanship is to constantly seek environments with better learning opportunities. This means surrounding yourself with other craftsmen who are more skilled than you are. Unfortunately, there is no incentive to risk hiring a candidate that may not be able to contribute in delivering on the team's workload.

**Solution**

Develop concrete skills which you can demonstrate. Some of these skills are more rudimentary in that they will allow you to bypass the buzzword bingo filters, while others show that you be of benefit the team. 

Concrete skills can be proficiency in your first language and its standard libraries, DevOps knowledge, and experience with popular frameworks. The more of these discrete skills you possess, the more confidence a team can have in your ability to contribute directly and indirectly to the team. 

You must possess enough concrete skills to justify the risk that the hiring manager takes in choosing you.

## Expose Your Ignorance

As an apprentice working for an organisation, you are still depended upon, in some capacity, to deliver value. You aren't familiar with the problem at hand and some of the technologies being used.

**Solution**

While you may want to appear competent, you know that you have areas of ignorance and inexperience. Demonstrate to the managers and team that you are dependable, even when deep in the learning process. Show them that growth and learning is integral to delivering software. 

Don't cave to the pressures of software delivery - there will always be more work to do. Instead, tell the truth - that you're in the learning process and understanding what is required. Create confidence in your ability to learn, rather than by telling them you know things that you don't.

Exposing your ignorance is most easily manifested by asking questions. More experienced developers will assume knowledge as certain skills and technologies have become second-nature for them. You can accelerate your progression to a journeyman by asking questions directly.

Do not shy away from exposing your ignorance. This can lead to become an expert in particular technologies but not a craftsman - experts will stick around in familiar territories of technologies, while craftsmen will work with many different technologies throughout their journey, gaining more expertise and indeed preference for some.

## Confront Your Ignorance

All throughout your journey, you will come to recognise gaps in your skills which are necessary for your work. These gaps may be skills that your team already possesses and expect the same of you.

**Solution**

Select one of the gaps you have discovered and actively learn in order to fill that gap. Acquiring this skill can be done in your preferred learning style, even if as simply as asking an expert and working together using the skill.

You can also fill gaps in private without exposing your ignorance, but be careful not to create a culture that discourages failure. Learning in public can often be preferable as it creates teaching opportunities.

On the flip side, you can also expose your ignorance without confronting it. Avoid this as you'll come to depend on your team to cover for your gaps and become genuinely ignorant (rather than being ignorant only to show desire to learn).

## The Deep End

Incremental learning is great, until it isn't. The small steps can be unsatisfying and lead to mediocrity as you never move to the next level. You need to add to your toolkit, improve your confidence, and have work that you are proud of and can talk about. You have a desire for new challenges, bigger projects, or increased complexity.

**Solution**

Jump at any opportunity to develop and flex some new muscles. You may not feel entirely ready, but you may well never feel ready, so when the opportunity arises, take it. The challenge comes with risk, but this is where growth happens - when you're stretched. Be prepared to fail, but don't lie about your capability in order to secure the opportunity.

This pattern should not be applied with a sense of recklessness - instead, it should be brave or rising up to the challenge. Reduce the risks by using patterns like Finding Mentors and Kindred Spirits, ensuring you have a support network in place before diving into the deep end. Create Feedback Loops to ensure you're staying on track and can get help when you need it.

## Retreat Into Competence

You may find yourself underwater where, for whatever reason, things aren't working. Whether because you don't know enough or you've taken a challenge too big to tackle.

**Solution**

Temporarily retreat into a safe area where you have established competence. Build something in that safe area and recognise the abilities that you have developed in your journey to date. This is similar to taking one step back in order to take several steps forward. Be sure to actually take those steps forward as soon as possible - rebound quickly from the step back.

Limit the use of this pattern using appropriate limits - timebox each usage to ensure that you do not retreat too far or too long. Get support from those around you where needed to bounce back sooner.
