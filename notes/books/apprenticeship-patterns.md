# Introduction

In the world of professional software development, the focus is on the technical solution to problems. Apprenticeship Patterns is aimed towards software apprentices - those that are getting started in developing software and can use the guidance of seasoned professionals. It zooms out and looks at the variety of non-technical dilemmas that developers, especially those new to the field, will encounter during their time in the profession. 

A pattern is a name and description of a recurring problem and solution which could be applied to other contexts. Patterns are valuable in the journey of becoming a master in software development and craftsmanship by lightening the mental load. This book will introduce a toolkit of patterns that can be drawn upon as software craftsmen. The patterns should be applied where appropriate and combined to amplify their benefits rather than used in isolation. Find opportunities within your context to do this.

## Software Craftsmanship

The term software craftsmanship has no single interpretation. The authors of this book have conveyed it as a a community of practice underpinned by several values. These values include:

- Growth mindset. Constantly look for and work towards improvement.
- Seek feedback and adapt with it.
- Be pragmatic as opposed to dogmatic. Careful with this one as the term pragmatic has become so overused and convoluted in meaning. We want to make those trade-off decisions where we favour a solution today over a perfect future. This isn't to say that we should intentionally make it difficult to adapt to future needs. Being pragmatic requires striking the right balance.
- Share knowledge to make advancements in software development rather than saving it for oneself. This can manifest in open source software.
- Try for the sake of experimentation. Be willing to be proven wrong and learn from it. Take from failures to improve for the next experiment.
- Take charge of your future. It is your responsibility to influence your destiny. Don't just wait for someone to come along with answers.
- A focus oneself rather than the group. We're not followers of a leader of software craftsmanship, rather we are all on the same journey. We must each improve our own skills to become valuable in a team.
- Inclusiveness. The background of the software developer - whether enterprise, computer science, software engineering, or otherwise - should be celebrated and seen as an opportunity to bring in the best elements of each discipline.
- Favour skill-centric over process-centric. Not everyone is at the same skill level, but we can all improve our skills. Simply adhering to a process or using a particular tool may not garner the same results for all, due to differing levels of skill.
- Make use of situated learning. Be in the room with people that are using the skills that you want to learn. Learning from osmosis.

## Apprentice

While fellow apprentices, journeymen, and masters are valuable in being an apprentice, they are not a requirement for apprenticeship. The overarching mindset must be of that there is always a better way to do things and more learning to be done.

Being an apprentice means taking responsibility and control over the apprenticeship and the outcomes. This means that we should seek the situations and people that afford (or even force) us to learn those better ways. Look for companies, teams, and mentors that can help you in this journey.

During your time as an apprentice, intentional learning and developing craftsmanship is the primary focus. You should have little responsibility outside of this primary focus. It is important at this stage to learn how you best learn.

Eventually, the gradual improvement during the apprenticeship will culminate in a progression to a journeyman. This transition can be seen by added responsibilities and expectations outside of just learning. 

## Journeyman

A journeyman is still focused on learning and improving their craft, but an additional focus is introduced. That is to make and improve connections between those in the craft. Intrateam communications should be refined. This responsibility will expand to also include mentoring apprentices and connecting with the industry at large.

As a journeyman, responsibilities are greater and failures can be less forgiving. Despite this, one must build on their craftsmanship by building a diverse and richer portfolio of applications. One should seek to become recognised in their community as a valuable player.

## Master

At mastery, a practitioner would use their skills and knowledge to enhance that of others while also encompassing the roles of an apprentice and a journeyman. The master amplifies the skills of the people around them. A master would propel the industry forward by creating new ways of working e.g. tools that change the way software developers do their work. They would also play a key role in training journeymen to become masters in their own right and more.

## Apprenticeship

The clich√© apprenticeship involves a young aspiring craftsman working in a blacksmith shop under an experienced master. The apprentice cleans around the shop and is sometimes involved in the forging process, but is constantly keeping an eye on what the master is doing and learning from the work being done. The apprentice becomes more involved and eventually becomes skilled enough to open their own shop, make a living, and become a master blacksmith.

The modern apprenticeship, while drawing similarities from its roots, is much different. It is more focused on the mindset of recognising that the apprentice is near the beginning of their journey as a craftsman and being prepared to take the opportunities provided to create their apprenticeship.

Most newcomers into the software industry will not have a formal apprenticeship and will have to make the most of their circumstances. They may face incompetent management, disengaged colleagues, relentless delivery pressure, and generally poor work environments.

Apprenticeship requires actively seeking opportunities to learn. It means finding skilled developers to learn from and work alongside. It requires a desire to be more than just competent developer and to instead be a software craftsman.
