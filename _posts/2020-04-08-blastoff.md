So a fair few things have changed since the last post: the internship ended; I secured a Protégé Developer position at MYOB in the [Future Maker's Academy](https://www.myob.com/au/careers/graduate-program) while finishing my final year at university; and I'm now based in Melbourne, Australia!

There's a whole of new experiences captured in that last point. I resigned from the Bank of New Zealand, packed my life into bags, and took the plunge across the ditch. I switched from the comfort of living with my parents to the freedom of living alone in a brand new city.

Enough preamble. Let's talk about the new job. The first few weeks have flown past. It took me over a month to set this up, but hey, it's here now.

I started on Tuesday 25 February 2020 alongside seven other protégés at MYOB's Richmond office. Our cohort have been collectively dubbed Katherine (after American mathematician, [Katherine Johnson](https://www.nasa.gov/content/katherine-johnson-biography), known for calculating trajectories for NASA missions to space :rocket:). As part of the orientation, we painted our own mobile library:

The new start was timed to perfection in relation to the [coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic). Onboarding and the first few weeks were completed in the office. I had time to settle into Melbourne, lease an apartment, and buy the basic amenities. Any later and I would have been struggling with living arrangements let alone being able to work from home.

My overwhelming feeling during this time of uncertainty blog post is gratefulness:
- safe with a roof over my head with food to eat
- able to continue working despite the pandemic
- technology allowing me to stay in contact with friends, family, and colleagues

**PS**: The [original commitment]({% post_url 2018-11-21-meet-the-interns %}) to writing this blog using Vim ended up being a deterrent to getting any posts out, so I'm not going to make that promise this time around!
