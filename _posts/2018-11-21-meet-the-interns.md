title: Meet the Interns!
---

Apologies for the delay in getting this first post out. Maybe one day I'll be able to use vim to work faster, but at the moment, it's my excuse for the delayed blog post. Anyway, behold, the MYOB Intern Developers:  

![interns-day-one.jpg](/assets/interns-day-one.jpg "The interns")  

From left to right: [Vilia Li](https://github.com/liappi), myself, [Sean Spires](https://github.com/seanspires) and [Jonathan Alphonso](https://github.com/rabadunk). Collectively, we've dubbed ourselves the "Pearltatoes" after our manager Mark Pearl.  

The first three weeks of the internship are allocated as "Intentional Learning", and as the name suggests, it's a whole bunch of learning! Here are a few things we've worked on so far:
- Source control using git
- Kanban
- FizzBuzz with TDD
- Tic Tac Toe in C#
- Eightball pool in real life  

I've committed to writing this entire blog in vim so there are two possibilities:
1. These posts become progressively longer and more detailed; or
2. What posts?  

Its now taken me over half an hour to write this post, so I'd better get to doing something else. Perhaps something not in vim.
