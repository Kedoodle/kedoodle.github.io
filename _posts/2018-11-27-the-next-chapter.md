Days since being asked about vim: 0. So Mark mentioned vim again. I suppose that can be my cue to write up another post. I've now got a vim cheatsheet in front of me, but it doesn't seem to be making much difference in terms of how fast I can work using vim. There's still hope yet, though.

The things I've focused on since the first post are in unit testing and adhering to the four simple rules of design. The latest katas that I've applied these on are Mastermind and Yatzy.
